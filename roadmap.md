## 1. What Is This Project?

A **multi-tenant booking system** where organizations can manage teams and members, and members can be booked for meetings/appointments.

- **Multi-tenant** means multiple organizations share the same database, but each can only see their own data.
- **Booking** means external or internal users can schedule time with members of an organization.

### How Auth Works (Step by Step)

1. **User opens the React app** and signs in via Supabase Auth (email/password, Google, etc.)
2. **Supabase Auth returns a JWT** — a signed token containing the user's `auth.users.id` in the `sub` claim
3. **React stores this JWT** and sends it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every API call to FastAPI
4. **FastAPI receives the request** and the auth dependency kicks in:
   - `jwt.py` → Verifies the JWT signature using `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` (HS256 algorithm). Checks that `sub` and `exp` claims exist. If the token is expired or tampered → **401 Unauthorized**
   - `member_lookup.py` → Queries the `members` table: "Is there an active member row with `auth_user_id` = the `sub` from the JWT?" If no match → **403 Forbidden** (user is authenticated in Supabase but not yet a member of any organization)
   - If both pass → returns a `Member` object with `id`, `organization_id`, `team_id`, `role`
5. **Route handler runs** with the resolved `Member`, knowing exactly who is calling and what role they have

### Why This Design?

- **FastAPI never handles passwords** — Supabase Auth does that. FastAPI only verifies the proof (JWT).
- **Service role key bypasses RLS** — We don't rely on Supabase RLS for backend security. FastAPI's dependency injection layer enforces who can do what.
- **`auth_user_id` is the bridge** — It links a Supabase Auth user (who can log in) to a `members` row (who has a role in an organization). An admin creates the member row first, then when the user signs up and gets linked, they can access the system.

## 3. Tech Stack

| Layer            | Technology                 | Why                                           |
|------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Frontend         | React + Supabase JS Client | Handles UI + login/signup via Supabase Auth    |
| Backend API      | FastAPI (Python 3.9+)      | Fast, async, excellent dependency injection    |
| Database         | Supabase Postgres          | Managed Postgres with built-in Auth            |
| DB Client        | supabase-py (service_role) | Official Python SDK, bypasses RLS              |
| JWT Verification | PyJWT                      | HS256 token verification                       |
| Config           | Pydantic BaseSettings      | Type-safe env var loading with `.env` support  |
| Server           | Uvicorn                    | ASGI server for FastAPI                        |

## 4. Database Tables

| Table           | Status      | Purpose                                  |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| `members`       | ✅ Exists    | People who belong to an organization      |
| `organizations` | ✅ Exists    | Companies/businesses using the platform   |
| `teams`         | ✅ Exists    | Groups within an organization             |
| `bookings`      | ✅ Exists    | Scheduled meetings/appointments           |

### `members` Table Schema

| Column                 | Type          | Nullable | Notes                                    |
|------------------------|---------------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| `id`                   | UUID (PK)     | No       | Auto-generated primary key                |
| `organization_id`      | UUID (FK)     | No       | Which organization this member belongs to |
| `team_id`              | UUID (FK)     | Yes      | Which team (null for super_admins)        |
| `role`                 | text          | No       | `super_admin` / `team_admin` / `member`   |
| `auth_user_id`         | UUID (FK)     | Yes      | Link to `auth.users.id` — null until user signs up and is linked |
| `full_name`            | text          | No       | Display name                              |
| `email`                | text          | No       | Contact email                             |
| `is_active_for_booking`| boolean       | No       | Can this member be booked?                |
| `deleted_at`           | timestamptz   | Yes      | Soft delete — NULL means active, timestamp means deleted |

#### Key Relationships:
- `members.organization_id` → `organizations.id`
- `members.team_id` → `teams.id`
- `members.auth_user_id` → `auth.users.id` (Supabase Auth)

#### Important Behavior:
- A member can exist **before** they have a Supabase Auth account (`auth_user_id = NULL`). An admin pre-creates the member row, and the user signs up later.
- **Soft deletes**: We never hard-delete members. We set `deleted_at` to the current timestamp. All queries filter with `deleted_at IS NULL`.

## 6. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Roles

| Role           | Scope          | Typical Permissions                          |
|----------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `super_admin`  | Organization   | Full access — manage teams, members, settings |
| `team_admin`   | Team           | Manage their team's members and bookings      |
| `member`       | Self           | View own profile, manage own availability     |

### How It's Enforced

**`get_current_member`** — Use when any authenticated member can access:
```python
@router.get("/my-bookings")
async def list_my_bookings(member: Member = Depends(get_current_member)):
    # Any authenticated member can see their own bookings
    ...
```

**`require_role("super_admin")`** — Use when only specific roles can access:
```python
@router.delete("/members/{member_id}")
async def delete_member(member: Member = Depends(require_role("super_admin"))):
    # Only super_admins can delete members
    ...
```

**`require_role("super_admin", "team_admin")`** — Multiple roles:
```python
@router.put("/teams/{team_id}")
async def update_team(
    member: Member = Depends(require_role("super_admin", "team_admin")),
):
    # Both super_admins and team_admins can update teams
    ...
```

> **Safety feature**: If you pass an invalid role string like `require_role("admin")`, the app crashes at startup with a clear error — not silently at request time.

## 7. Error Handling Reference

Every error the auth layer can return:

| Scenario                                  | HTTP Status | Error Message                                                   | Where It's Raised         |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| No `Authorization` header sent            | **403**     | `"Not authenticated"`                                           | FastAPI's `HTTPBearer`    |
| Token format wrong (not a JWT)            | **401**     | `"Invalid authentication token."`                               | `auth/jwt.py`             |
| JWT signature doesn't match secret        | **401**     | `"Invalid authentication token."`                               | `auth/jwt.py`             |
| JWT is expired (`exp` in the past)        | **401**     | `"Token has expired."`                                          | `auth/jwt.py`             |
| JWT missing `sub` or `exp` claims         | **401**     | `"Invalid authentication token."`                               | `auth/jwt.py`             |
| Valid JWT but `sub` is empty              | **403**     | `"Token does not contain a valid user identity."`               | `auth/member_lookup.py`   |
| Valid JWT but no member row matches       | **403**     | `"No linked member account found. Contact your org admin..."`   | `auth/member_lookup.py`   |
| Valid JWT + member found, but wrong role  | **403**     | `"This action requires one of the following roles: ..."`        | `dependencies/auth.py`    |

## 11. Implementation Log

### ✅ Phase 1 — Authentication Layer (2025-06-25)

**Goal**: Implement FastAPI auth that verifies Supabase-issued JWTs and resolves the calling member from the database.

**What was built**:

| File                        | What It Does                                              |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `app/config.py`             | Loads env vars via Pydantic BaseSettings with `.env` file |
| `app/services/supabase.py`  | Creates a cached Supabase client using service_role key   |
| `app/models/member.py`      | `Member` model, `MemberRole` enum, response schema        |
| `app/auth/jwt.py`           | Verifies JWT (HS256), extracts `sub` as `auth_user_id`    |
| `app/auth/member_lookup.py` | Queries `members` table by `auth_user_id`, filters soft-deletes |
| `app/dependencies/auth.py`  | `get_current_member` dependency, `require_role()` factory |
| `app/routes/me.py`          | `GET /me` endpoint returning member profile               |
| `app/main.py`               | FastAPI app creation, router mounting, `/health` endpoint |

**Design decisions made**:

1. **Service role key for backend** — RLS exists but is not relied upon for backend security. FastAPI enforces all access control.
2. **JWT and DB lookup are separate functions** — `jwt.py` knows nothing about the database. `member_lookup.py` knows nothing about JWTs. They're composed together in `get_current_member`. This makes each independently testable.
3. **`require_role` validates at import time** — Passing a typo like `"admn"` fails immediately at startup, not at request time when a user hits the endpoint.
4. **Soft deletes** — All member queries filter `deleted_at IS NULL`. We never hard-delete.
5. **`.limit(1)` instead of `.single()`** — More compatible across supabase-py versions.

**Test results** (2025-06-25):

| Test Case                          | Expected    | Actual      | ✅ |
|------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|---|
| `GET /health`                      | `200 OK`    | `200 OK`    | ✅ |
| `GET /me` — no token               | `403`       | `403`       | ✅ |
| `GET /me` — fake token             | `401`       | `401`       | ✅ |
| `GET /me` — valid JWT, no member   | `403`       | `403`       | ✅ |
| Supabase connection                | Connected   | Connected   | ✅ |
| Members table schema match         | All 9 cols  | All 9 cols  | ✅ |
